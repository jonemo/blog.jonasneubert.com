# Project Description

This job is to fix up various problems with my personal website and blog.

The current state: My personal website and blog have been on minimal "life support" for many years. I am a software developer, but don't normally work on websites. My own attempts to try out frameworks and tools have left a pile of technical debt and a low quality product.

These are the website and blog and the repos behind them:

- Website: <https://jonasneubert.com>, <https://github.com/jonemo/jonasneubert.com>
- Blog: <https://blog.jonasneubert.com>, <https://github.com/jonemo/blog.jonasneubert.com>

Tasks:

1. Update website and blog to use modern static site generator. Preference for Hugo but open to discussing other options.
2. Change blog site layout to match website
3. Clean up CSS to remove technical debt
4. Confirm that page (still) works on both small and large screen sizes and fix any existing or newly introduced problems
5. Work through list of small content/design/layout changes (see attachment). This may involve some back-and-forth with me.

Things to not change:

- Should use static site generator
- Store content in Github repo(s)
- Host as Github pages
- Subdomain for blog

I know that this is a broad mix of technical, design, and consulting work. It's ok if you only want to work on a subset (e.g. only convert to Hugo but not work on design changes). Please mention in your proposal what exactly you can offer.
