This blog post is my (not sponsored) writeup of the experience of not getting a Google Fiber internet connection in Salt Lake City.
Spoiler: I published this in March 2023 over a Comcast Xfinity connection.

We moved to Salt Lake City in the middle of last year and in January we bought a house here.
Salt Lake City is one of the 25 or so cities in the US where Google Fiber internet service is available.
It's impossible not to know about that when you live here.
While living at our previous address, we received Google Fiber flyers in the mail almost weekly, saw annoyingly frequent repeats of their Youtube ads, so many online ads, full-page ads in the free local newspaper, billboards, etc.

Amusingly, we received this advertising barrage while living at an address where Google Fiber wasn't even available.
(Doesn't Google Fiber's sister company, the one with the same name minus the "Fiber", specialize in targeted online ads?)

#### 2022-12-30

On this day it was all but certain that the house purchase will close on January 4th.

We treated getting an internet connection as a high priority because it would allow us to work-from-home from the new house on days when contractors needed to be let in or deliveries would arrive.
We had confirmed that Google Fiber is available at the address before we made the offer on the house.
It was the obvious choice: We had only heard positive things about Google Fiber and overwhelmingly negative things about Comcast Xfinity, the only alternative.
Plus, we've been happy Webpass customers for many years.[^1]

I went to the Google Fiber website, signed up for the $70/month "1 Gig" plan, and scheduled installation for Saturday, January 7th, at 12:30 pm.
Immediately after confirming the installation appointment, the website informs me that a crew will dig a "micro trench" from the street to the house at any time between now and the installation date.
They will also install a box on the side of the house, I'd later hear them call it NIU (Network Interface Unit) or "[network jack](https://support.google.com/fiber/answer/2480940)".

> Before your in-home installation appointment, our Google Fiber installation specialist will come out to ensure the Network Interface Unit (NIU) is installed on the side of your home (if you don't have one already). [Learn more](https://support.google.com/fiber/answer/3093465).

Seems like an important detail that they will just show up at an unspecified time and dig a "micro trench" through the front yard and attached a thing somewhere on the house exterior.
What if I have a locked gate? Or the grounds outside the house are owned by an HOA? Or my pitbull will attack trespassers? Or they damage my million dollar garden gnome collection? Or the house isn't even owned by me when they show up? And how do they know where on the house would be a good place do install the box?[^2] (Just a few examples, not all of them apply in our case.)

#### 2023-01-07 12:30pm

The Google Fiber technician arrives right on time and quickly notices that there is no NIU on the house.
Therefore, he can't do his work.
He is only responsible for plugging a WiFi router into an existing NIU.
We chat for a little while, then he files a ticket for another team that is responsible for the NIU, and drives off to the his appointment.

Thanks for being a Google Fiber customer.

#### 2023-01-07 1:15pm

The other team arrives.
They notice that there is no NIU installed on the house.
They are responsible for the maintenance of existing NIUs and fiber connections, not for installing them.
Not sure what else to do, they suggest I call the Google Fiber hotline and also drive off.
For what it's worth, one of the guys says, he lives a few blocks away and has Google Fiber in his house.
So this process has worked at least once before!

#### 2023-01-07

As instructed, I call (866) 777-7550 to ask what's going on.
I learn that Google Fiber outsources the fiber drop to a third party.
They have a work order out for this third party and it sometimes happens that the job doesn't get done by the time of the install appointment.
Unfortunately, Google Fiber has no information about the work order other than its incomplete status.
There is nobody at the third party who can be called or contacted to inquire.
Just give it a couple more days, is the suggestion.
A $25 credit will be applied to my account in exchange for the trouble this has caused.
Wait a second, am I getting charged the monthly fee already!? — No, the $70/month only start after a successful install.

#### 2023-01-09

We say hello to our new neighbors.
They saw the Google Fiber car on Saturday and want to hear about our experience with them.
They've been thinking about switching to Google Fiber too.
We tell them that we're cautiously optimistic.

#### 2023-01-10

Another call to (866) 777-7550.
It's been another couple of days, any news? — No.

While I have them on the phone, just checking: Is it really the standard process to do the fiber drop without the homeowner's involvement? — Yes it is.
The third-party installers show up when they want, install the NIU wherever they want, and dig the trench in whichever way they deem right.
My questions about the practicality of doing it this way are politely deflected.
There is an option to book a consultation with an expert who will explain the installation process to me.
Said expert is fully booked for the next four weeks, so this would install the installation significantly.
In conclusion: I should regularly check the exterior of the house for the appearance of a small wall-mounted box, and once confirmed call Google Fiber to schedule another installation appointment.

#### 2023-01-17 7:57am

Calling my friends at (866) 777-7550 again.
Fun fact: The people answering the phone when I call Google Fiber are all located in cities where Google Fiber is not available.

I explain my store, get put on hold, the call drops.

#### 2023-01-17 8:00am

Another call, another agent to explain the situation to.

#### 2023-01-17 3:18pm

A call from the Google Fiber number!
I'm in a work meeting and can't answer.
They don't leave a message.

#### 2023-01-17 6:24pm

Hi, I spoke with your colleagues about problems with my Google Fiber installation this morning.
They called back in the afternoon but I missed the call.
Can you check their notes to see what the update was?

No, he can't.

Thanks to lots of practice, I have a pretty concise way of explaining the situation.
Here's my chance to do another practice run.
How can I find out what the colleague from the 8am call did, and what should I do next?

This rep has less patience for my long story than his colleagues.
There are no notes from a prior call and there is nothing that can be done.
Just wait for the installation to happen!
Anything else he can help me with today?

#### 2023-01-18

I research the other options.
We're outside the coverage area of the smaller local ISPs and the new-fangled 5G-at-home offers aren't available at out address either.
Only Comcast Xfinity remains.
I bite the bullet but pick a monthly plan that I can cancel as soon as Google gets their act together.

After two calls to the Xfinity hotline, an hour in the website support chat, waiting out a short website outage, investigating a few Javascript errors in the Chrome developer console, trying out seven different combinations of phone number and identity verification method and email address, and a visit to the local Xfinity store, Comcast accepts me as a customer.
Once I had figured out that the coax outlet with the word "internet" scratched into cover plate is not connected to the internet, I was connected.
A walk in the park compared to signing up for Google Fiber.

A robocall from Google.
"Please schedule your Google Fiber installation as soon as possible!"

I call the hotline, give a quick summary of everything that happened so far, and inform them that their system is about to cancel my account.
After a few minutes on hold while the rep reviews the notes on my account, I learn that this is not how this is supposed to go and that something is not right.
He also mentions that the original work order for my address has a note from early January saying that the fiber drop was not possible due to "weather".
That's interesting considering that his colleagues on prior calls could not see any information on the work order.

While talking with me, the rep text chatted with a supervisor who helped escalate my case.
I was sent on my way with an escalation case number and a promise to hear back within 72 hours.
To trick the system into not canceling my account, we scheduled a "fake install appointment" a month into the future.

The neighbor stops by.
"How's the Google Fiber working out?"

Good reminder, I would have missed our "just a placeholder" install appointment.
I plan my weekend accordingly and look forward to another friendly but pointless meeting with the Google Fiber install crew.

I tweeted about this blog post. @googlefiber responds:

> Hi Jonas, apologies for the rough start to your Fiber experience. Please don't hesitate to shoot me a DM and I'll be glad to check on this to provide feedback and to see if I can help. -Gregory

I'm not sure what I could DM them beyond what they already know, so I pass.

#### 2023-04-08

It's been an exciting month since I wrote this blog post. Warm spring weather mixed with several winter storms. The construction work on our house is coming together nicely. No news from Google Fiber.

#### A note about the weather

I suspect that the weather plays a role in this story.
Salt Lake City is a past, and maybe also future, host city for the Winter Olympics Games.
We are in the middle of a winter with above-average snowfall.
In January and February 2023, SLC had a few weeks with more than a foot of snow on the ground and below-freezing daily high temperatures—as well as other weeks with higher temperatures and sunshine when most of the snow melted away.

If there had been any communication between the fiber drop crew and me, the homeowner, we could have figured this out and planned around the weather forecast.
I could have shoveled any offending snow out of the way, and suggested NIU mounting location closer to the street than the default.
If you choose to operate in Salt Lake City, the occasional snow day shouldn't cause a complete process failure in your system, even when you're headquartered in fair-weathered Mountain View.

[^1]: [Webpass has been part of Google Fiber since 2016](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Fiber#Acquisition_of_Webpass) but seemed to be operating independently when we were their customers.

[^2]: I later learned that the NIU install crews are instructed to place the NIU near the gas meter. That makes for an unnecessarily complicated installation at our house because the fiber needs to be run under or around exterior stairs to the basement wall. Just so we can then run the Ethernet cable back up to the main floor where we'll place the router.
