title: My US Travel Map
---

I have wanted to create a visualization of some of my travels for a long time but always got stuck procrastinating the details: Which arbitrary geographical divisions to use? Countries? Cities? Do transfer airports count?

[This random Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/a9cu33/finally_finished_a_map_of_everywhere_ive_been_i/)[^reddit] gave me the motivation to finally do _something_. Following the example of the Redditor who posted this, I used [mapchart.net](https://mapchart.net/usa-counties.html) to color-code the counties[^counties] of the US according to whether I had been there.

Here's my US Travel Map as of March 2019:

The best part of travel, to me anyway, are the memories that I get from it. The few hours it took to research past trips in order to create this map were a great opportunity to recall those, from the crowded bus rides between Ithaca and New York City to the amazing thunderstorms we saw from our Amtrak bunk bed near Omaha. While I don't remember every US county I passed through (sorry, Lincoln County Oregon and Kearney County NE), I could tell you a story about the journey that brought me there and the day of for each and every one.

It seems sensible then to add color to a few more of those outlines on the map! Thanks to the decision-making help of [seven anonymous Twitter followers](https://twitter.com/jonemo/status/1102092116728012801) I am right now planning a road trip from Cleveland to Nashville (directly following PyCon which is held in Cleveland this year). Send me an email or a [tweet](https://twitter.com/jonemo) if you have recommendations for which route to take and where to stop along the way!

[^counties]: Using counties as sub-division results in a few interesting artifacts like checking off almost half of Nevada on a single train ride across the state. A few counties are included because a road dips into it for a mile or so. Islands on the map are big hub airports that I have passed through: Miami, Charlotte, Seattle, etc.
