title: List of PLC brands and products

tl;dr: [Here's the link to the spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15R6rOn6HexPPkxQu_sHcqVbk_W1myLeLFAvGkUWLZfw/edit?usp=sharing).

I've been thinking about Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC) again recently, not least because I am preparing [a conference talk](https://us.pycon.org/2019/schedule/presentation/237/) about them. While putting together the presentation I thought to myself "Why not make a list of PLC products out there, I wonder how many there areâ€½"

Turns out, there are quite a few! After three evenings of research I had a spreadsheet of 144 product lines. That number shouldn't be a surprise given that this is a 50-year-old technology that is ubiquitous in factories, infrastructure, and machinery.

Of course, I'm barely more than an interested bystander to this industry, so I decided to ask real automation engineering practicioners about what I had missed in my review. No better way to get harsh feedback on your work than to [put it on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/PLC/comments/bd7u0q/made_a_spreadsheet_of_plc_brands_and_products_did/)!

It's three weeks later now and the trickle of comments has dried up, but I am still working on including all of the suggestions in the spreadsheet, which is currently 225 lines long. You can take a look and add your own comments here: **[Link to the Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15R6rOn6HexPPkxQu_sHcqVbk_W1myLeLFAvGkUWLZfw/edit?usp=sharing)**

In the meantime, I also discovered Wikipedia's [List of PLC Manufacturers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_PLC_manufacturers). Quite a few of the brands listed there are also still missing from my spreadsheet.

One day I might aggregate and summarize the information into a more digestable format. For now, I have collected a limited number of columns of metadata and started classifying the entries by a few interesting criteria relevant to me, such as whether they are modular systems. I decided to be strict about only calling things a "PLC" that support at least one [IEC-61131-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEC_61131-3) language, and labeled other entries "RIO" (Remote Input/Output) or "Smart Relay". Some Reddit commentors called me out for not including many Safety PLCs, a subject I need to do some reading to do on before I can claim any level of understanding.

And there were, of course, complaints about not including DCS, HMI, SCADA, and other related product types. I don't have the time to create those spreadsheets, but someone else should!
