title: The Cubelets arrived!
---

<p>Exciting times in modular robotics land! A <a href="http://www.modrobotics.com/eric/">former coworker of mine</a> started a company aptly named "<a href="http://www.modrobotics.com/">Modular Robotics</a>" who, over the past years, developed a modular robotic <strike>toy</strike> construction kit named <a href="http://www.modrobotics.com/cubelets">Cubelets</a>. After spending years <a href="http://www.modrobotics.com/blog/?p=195">finding out how hard developing a hardware product is</a>, they finally shipped the first batch of 100 beta release kits recently shipped. Being excited about having modular robots around that (unlike my own research modular robots) function reliably, I couldn't resist shooting a short video of my first experiments with Cubelets.&nbsp;</p>
